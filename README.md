# 'Linux Commands' in MS-DOS

This is a set of simple files that you can copy into your DOS folder to 'replicate' common Linux commands.

I got tired of typing them in my retro MS-DOS rig only to be greeted with `Bad command or file name`.

These could probably be better but eh, they do the job just fine.
